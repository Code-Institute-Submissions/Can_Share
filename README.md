Can share was spurned out of a love for beer with good friends, where once a month we would meet up at our local brewery, bring a can each of whatever style of beer, 
all have a sample each and give our opinions on taste, smell, mouth feel/ body, colour, can or bottle design and how the can/bottle feels in the touch. Is it a 
quality beer in a shoddy can or a shoddy beer in a quality can then after trying a few (hick) we do an overall rating of the beer we have sampled.

The site is directed at Beer lovers and hobbyists rather than businesses.

#### The users goals of this website are:
* Rate beers and create, update, and delete beers.
* Clearly displaying Can logo art and credentials.
* Easy to navigate. 

#### The Business potentials of this website are:
* Selling advertising space to businesses with beer related products.
* 

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* Their favorite beers.
* Ideas of what to try next and where to possibly purchase the cans of choice.

#### This Website is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Other websites are too cluttered and hard to navigate.
* Other websites fail to have links to places to purchase the product.

#### This website is:
* Uncluttered and has an intuitive search process.
* Providing clear artwork and and details of each can.
